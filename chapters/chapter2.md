# Overview

We will take the paper [Nakagawa 2017](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-017-0357-7) as a blueprint to walk you through all the steps of a meta-analysis.

Here is a graphical overview (Figure 1 from Nakagawa 2017):

All of these steps have to be described and laid out in a protocol. We will see that there already exist general protocols for each step, which we can use and adapt it to our research question. The aim of having a relatively strict protocol is that other researchers have to be able to reproduce those steps. 

Protocols are necessary to minimize any bias that might be introduced - either knowingly, but most often unknowingly - into the decisions that have to be taken at each meta-analysis step. Bias might already be present in how the research question we want to tackle is phrased. Further, bias can originate in the specific way we search for literature, both in where we search (for example, which data bases we use, or whether we only include published results), and how we search (for example our choice of search terms).

The following diagram shows a more in depth overview, starting from the literature search (Nakagawa et al. 2017).

# Literature search

There are different protocols for how to gather the literature for a systematic meta-analysis. We will walk through a specific literature search below, using one established protocol. Please note that this is in itself an active area of research though. For example, I would like to mention the *[metaverse](https://rmetaverse.github.io/)*, a collection of R packages that is aimed at integrating all steps of a meta-analysis. The package *[litsearchR](https://elizagrames.github.io/litsearchr/)* seems especially promising, and you could try it out on your local R installation (right now, I haven't installed it in the R software container you will be using during this course / online).
