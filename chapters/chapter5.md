<exercise id="1" title="Links for Meta-Analysis">

**[If you work on / have published on meta analyses and think your work should be included here, please get in touch!]**

## Other online resources / courses / tutorials on meta analyses 
All of the freely available resources listed here provide much more detail, specifically on the stats, than what has been provided here. Please note, there are many more (print and online) resources on Meta analysis available, but I have decided to her only provide links to freely accessible resources. You may notice that the focus quickly shifts away from biology, more towards psychology / social sciences, as these are highly active fields of research utilizing meta analysis, and hence have developed great resources:

- Shinichi's short workshops on the "Environmental Computing" site, [Meta analysis 1](http://environmentalcomputing.net/meta-analysis-1/), [2](http://environmentalcomputing.net/meta-analysis-2/) and [3](http://environmentalcomputing.net/meta-analysis-3/)

- Background on [OpenMEE](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.12708)
