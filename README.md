# Meta-analysis for Biologists - an online starter course

### Hello and welcome! 
This repository contains the resources for my starter course on meta-analysis, 
**Meta-analysis for Biologists**, which can be found and used here: 
<http://metaanalysis.zajitschek.net/>

The course material has been designed after working with our collaborators [Shinichi Nakagawa](http://www.i-deel.org/) and [Malgorzata Lagisz](http://www.i-deel.org/), and learning lots about meta-analysis! 

The technical side of this site was developed and made available by <a href='https://ines.io/'>Ines Montani</a>, who created her course [spaCy course](https://course.spacy.io) and made it publicly available, including step-by-step instructions of how to adapt and host the course (https://github.com/ines/course-starter-r). Thanks for that, Ines!
